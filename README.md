# Custom RobotLocalization Project

This project is about creating and testing 2 robots in a Robot Operating System(ROS) simulation environment. The
UdacityBot and FouliexBot use Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization(AMCL) combined with a navigation stack to navigate a maze and
reach a predefined destination position.
